# MCP (Model Context Protocol) + MCP Hub

- **What it is**: A protocol for connecting external tool/resource servers, plus a hub that manages MCP connections.

## Capabilities

- Multiple transports (local stdio, remote HTTP/SSE).
- OAuth support for remote servers.
- Allowlisting/disablement of tools.
- Auto-reconnect and error history.

## Docs references

- [`apps/kilocode-docs/pages/automate/mcp/overview.md`](../../apps/kilocode-docs/pages/automate/mcp/overview.md)

## Suggested migration

- **Kilo CLI availability**: Already.
- **Migration recommendation**:
  - Prefer Kilo CLI server MCP endpoints for MCP lifecycle, tool routing, and execution.
  - Keep VS Code UI and approval/consent surfaces in the extension host.
- **Reimplementation required?**: No.
