# Cloud Task Support

**GitHub Issue:** [#168](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo/issues/168)
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## Description

Support for persisting tasks to the Kilo cloud, and restoring sessions that were saved to the Kilo cloud but started on other devices or clients.

## Requirements

- Save task state to Kilo cloud storage
- Restore/resume tasks that were started on other devices or clients
- Sync task history across devices
- Handle conflict resolution when tasks are modified on multiple devices
- Require Kilo authentication for cloud features

## Current State

No cloud task support exists. Tasks are stored locally by the CLI.

## Gaps

- No cloud sync infrastructure
- No API endpoints for cloud task storage (may need backend work)
- No conflict resolution strategy
- No UI for cloud task browsing/restoring
- Depends on [Task History](task-history.md) being implemented first
- Depends on [Authentication](authentication-organization-enterprise-enforcement.md) for Kilo cloud access
